# about me
deep interest in systems/applications/however you name it programming. <br>
analyzing & researching anticheats. <br>
fully against invasive anticheats - if its lower level than serversided or clientsided (usermode) then it deserves to get bypassed. <br>
i mostly develop for windows because of my hardware compatibility, but i generally prefer linux over it in every aspect. <br>
most of my projects are private.
